                <p>Hello! <br/> I'm Sivagambigai,Pronunciation of my name is Sivagaambigai(Sivagambigai).For example Vellore=Veloor and its my native.Haaa(great relief!)because most of the people never used to pronounce my name properly,whenever I meet new people, they used to give me various varieties of names:) sometimes its cool but most of the time its weird.Experienced people can understand this!(Kinda joke). Now I hope you know my name clearly if I type it again you will smash me like a tomoto.</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt=""/></div>

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic004.jpg" alt=""/></div>
                <p>As I mentioned before I love to speak and share my thoughts to others.I got a chance to bloom like a flower to spread an amazing fragrance of my innovative ideas to others with the help of a wonderful platform called <b>Toastmasters International</b>.To add more colours and meanings to the purpose of my public speaking life,I've got  a chance to play as a <b>Sergeant at Arms in PIT Toastmasters club</b>.However, no matter I'm still a Sergeant at Arms of the same club and I'm proud to be a Sergeant at Arms of my mother club.To prove that I'm a better leader & a good public speaker again I got a chance in Studymonk to play as a <b>team leader</b> and guide my teammates to achieve their goal in their lives and <b> I'm the current President of Orators Forum.</b></p>
                <p><h3>To know more about the secrets of my life jump into my cloud nine!</h3></p>
